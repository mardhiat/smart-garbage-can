# Smart Garbage Can (Arduino Project)

This is an Arduino-powered smart garbage can that detects **metal**, **plastic**, and **general waste**, then uses servo motors to sort them into separate bins.

---

## Objective

To automate waste sorting using sensors and servos, helping with eco-friendly recycling and efficient disposal.

---

## Background / Motivation

Manual waste sorting can be time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to contamination of recyclable materials. This project aims to simplify the process by automatically detecting and sorting metal, plastic, and general waste, encouraging better recycling habits.

---

## Components

- Metal sensor (analog)  
- Plastic detection sensor (e.g., IR sensor or ML mock)  
- 2x Servo motors (for lid movement or bin rotation)  
- 3x LED lights (green for metal, blue for plastic, red for trash)  
- Arduino Uno  
- Breadboard + jumper wires  

---

## How It Works

- The garbage can uses sensors to detect the type of material inserted.  
- Based on detection:  
  - **Metal** ‚ûù Green LED on ‚ûù Servo rotates to metal bin  
  - **Plastic** ‚ûù Blue LED on ‚ûù Servo rotates to plastic bin  
  - **Other trash** ‚ûù Red LED on ‚ûù Servo keeps default position  
- After sorting, the lid closes and resets for the next item.  

---

## Features

- Automatic waste classification  
- Real-time feedback with colored LEDs  
- Motorized sorting with servo control  
- Expandable for smart home or school projects  

---

## Usage Instructions

1. Connect the sensors, LEDs, and servos to the Arduino as specified in the code.  
2. Upload the Arduino code to the board using the Arduino IDE.  
3. Power the Arduino and test the system by placing metal or plastic items near the sensors.  

---

## Future Work

- Integrate plastic detection sensor fully and add related servo control.  
- Implement machine learning models for improved material classification.  
- Design and 3D-print a custom enclosure for a finished prototype.

## Code

```cpp
int ledGreen = 5;
int ledRed = 6;
int servoPin = 9;
int metalSensor = A0;  // Analog metal sensor
int sensorThreshold = 100;

#include <Servo.h>
Servo myServo;

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledGreen, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ledRed, OUTPUT);
  myServo.attach(servoPin);
  myServo.write(0);  // Initial position
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(metalSensor);
  Serial.println(sensorValue);

  if (sensorValue > sensorThreshold) {
    digitalWrite(ledGreen, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(ledRed, LOW);
    myServo.write(90);  // Rotate to push metal item
    delay(1000);
    myServo.write(0);   // Reset
  } else {
    digitalWrite(ledGreen, LOW);
    digitalWrite(ledRed, HIGH);
    myServo.write(0);  // Stay still
  }

  delay(500);
}
