# Smart Garbage Can (Arduino Project)

This is an Arduino-powered smart garbage can that detects **metal**, **plastic**, and **general waste**, then uses servo motors to sort them into separate bins.

## Objective
To automate waste sorting using sensors and servos, helping with eco-friendly recycling and efficient disposal.

## Components
- Metal sensor (analog)
- Plastic detection sensor (e.g., IR sensor or ML mock)
- 2x Servo motors (for lid movement or bin rotation)
- 3x LED lights (green for metal, blue for plastic, red for trash)
- Arduino Uno
- Breadboard + jumper wires

## How It Works
- The garbage can uses sensors to detect what kind of material is inserted.
- Based on detection:
  - **Metal** ‚ûù Green LED on ‚ûù Servo rotates to metal bin
  - **Plastic** ‚ûù Blue LED on ‚ûù Servo rotates to plastic bin
  - **Other trash** ‚ûù Red LED on ‚ûù Servo keeps default position
- After sorting, the lid closes and resets for the next item.

## Features
- Automatic waste classification
- Real-time feedback with colored LEDs
- Motorized sorting with servo control
- Expandable for smart home or school projects
